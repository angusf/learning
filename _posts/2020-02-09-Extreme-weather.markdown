I do believe that the climate is changing. I'm convinced that it is destabilising or breaking down due to human activity.

It has grown noticeably hotter and more erratic during my lifetime and the last few years seem worse than any that I've known before.

The last few months we've been through the hottest recorded heat in many parts of Australia, the largest most widespread bushfires starting earlier than ever before. And now immediately afterwards we have many consecutive days of rain and wind bringing flooding in many places.

As I look out at the endless white veil of rain blown horizontally across the park since I woke this morning I hope that there will be stable and idilic periods again soon. That we won't have to change our behaviour first and then wait hundreds of years for those changes to take effect before we can have pleasant days again.
