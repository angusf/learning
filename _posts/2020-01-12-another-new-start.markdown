I've had various variations of a personal website since the mid 1990's at this domain.

Initially it was a static collection of html pages, then in about 2002 I built a PHP based CMS with blog, image galleries and links pulled from delicious. Around 2007 I decided to switch to Wordpress and despite grand ambitions to write never moved beyond a stream of my photos. I'm guessing after suffering a couple of hacking attacks I decided to give a static site generator a go in 2017 but never added more than the original post.

This is another attempt at personal publishing in 2020.
