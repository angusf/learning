 It's incredible how much overhead there is to learning anything new in web development now. Each bit of new knowledge is inexplicably intertwined with other bits so that hours easly pass while you try and untangle them to understand what it is you actually know how to do. 

 To get this post published locally I've had to download and install Ruby, NPM, Jekyll and read and watch a couple of hours worth of instruction. 

 I'll leave using my own theme and deploying to my own hosting for another day.
