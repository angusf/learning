So long since i wrote a post that I've forgotten how to update this site.

Since last post where i was concerned about apocalyptic bushfires caused by climate change there has been a global pandemic killing hundreds of thousands of people.

In Sydney we have been in "lock down" with most hospitality businesses closed and most office workers working from home. Governments are slowly allowing businesses to open back up now for example a cafe can have up to 10 customers provided they stay more than 1.5 meters apart. Australians are encouraged to install an app the government created on their phones that allows contact tracing by sharing data with gov about what other phones you were nearby for more than 15 minutes.

Writing above it's hard to imagine making it up at time of my last post. Now I wonder what normal will look like if pandemic is coming to an end.
