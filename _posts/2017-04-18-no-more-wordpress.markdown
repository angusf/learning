 I am decomissioning the Wordpress installation I've been using on this domain since maybe 2005 but hadn't done anything with for years other than to spend a few futile hours every few months cleaning up a ratsnest of malware. 

 Now my intention is to learn to use a static site generator like Jekyll which should have less maintenance overhead.
