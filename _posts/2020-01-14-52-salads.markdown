Just before the new year I made commitment to myself to eat more plants and it occurred to me that I don't have much of a salad repertoire. So I decided to make at least 52 salads I've not made before over 2020. I've made about 6 new salads so far.

My plan is to create another site likely using Jekyll to document and share them. I imagine it will be very simple site with just the recipes with one photo and no endless SEO oriented preambles.

I'm curious how much Adsense revenue such a site would make. How much green would it make.
