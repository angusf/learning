A few times a year I regret not doing art everyday to build up a collection and learn through practice. So with my latest [online improv class at ITS](https://improvtheatresydney.com.au/) coming to an end and wanting a break I pulled out the watercolours and spent several hours painting last weekend. I had an idea for something else to paint this weekend but sadly when I looked at last week's effort I was unimpressed and lost motivation so it's now Sunday afternoon and I haven't made  start yet.
